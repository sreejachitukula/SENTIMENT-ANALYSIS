# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK4:

Sentiment analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves extracting subjective information from text data—commonly to determine whether the expressed opinion is positive, negative, or neutral. This process is widely used in analyzing social media posts, customer reviews, feedback forms, and more. This task described here showcases sentiment analysis using Python, applying well-known NLP libraries and visualization tools to process and interpret textual data.

# 1.Tools and Libraries Used:

1.Pandas: This powerful library is used for data loading, manipulation, and exploration. It allows easy handling of structured datasets, such as CSV files, and is the backbone of many data science workflows.

2.NumPy: Essential for numerical operations, NumPy supports efficient array handling and mathematical operations that complement Pandas.

3.Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are used for data visualization. While Matplotlib provides basic plotting capabilities, Seaborn builds on it with more elegant and informative statistical graphics like count plots and distribution plots.

4.NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): One of the most established libraries for NLP tasks. In this project, it provides access to stop words and the VADER sentiment analysis tool, which is especially effective for analyzing sentiment in social media text.

5.TextBlob: A simple NLP library built on top of NLTK and Pattern. TextBlob provides an easy-to-use API for common NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, where it outputs polarity scores based on the underlying text.

6.WordCloud: This library is used to generate word cloud visualizations. It helps in identifying the most frequent terms used in positive, negative, or neutral text categories, giving an intuitive sense of the textual content distribution.

7.Regular Expressions (re): Used for cleaning the text data by removing punctuation, digits, and special characters, allowing us to focus on meaningful words.

# 2.Platforms for Development:
I used google collab for deveoping this task

Google Colab: A cloud-based environment similar to Jupyter Notebook, but hosted on Google’s servers. It’s highly convenient as it requires no setup, supports GPU acceleration, and allows seamless collaboration and sharing via Google Drive.
